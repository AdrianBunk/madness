To calculate CC2 ground-state and excitation energies:

Changes in operator.h are needed! (on all  branches except cc2-paper-2017 or cc2 tag)
See the corresponding commit on the cc2-paper-2017 branch or the comment at the end of this file

Configure Madness with Gentensor!
Autotools: '--enable-gentensor' 
Cmake: -D ENABLE_GENTENSOR=ON
-- autotools is recommended for this commit -- 

Compile Madness Libraries
Compile cc2 in the src/examples directory

Execute cc2 in the src/examples directory
(example input file can be found in the examples directory as well (only on the cc2-paper-2017 branch).


If you check out the current (September 2017 and before)  version of madness and not the cc2-tag or cc2-paper-2017 branch:
In oder to get the 6D Operations to work properly you need to change 2 lines in src/madness/mra/operator.h
which both look like:
//r = std::max(2L,r+(r&1L)); // NOLONGER NEED TO FORCE OPERATOR RANK TO BE EVEN
-> comment this back in
