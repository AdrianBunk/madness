diff(tree)
    assumes we already have coeffs at this node
    if (tree is local)
       left = get(...)
       add local task(left,tree,right)
    else
       forward diff request


can be invoked locally by diff ... want an SAV returned
can be invoked remotely by a forwarded operation, want a message sent

if the SAV is passed in, it will work via set.

need to worry about not setting SAVs with posted recvs ... at least
detect them, ideally unpost the recvs

get_make(tree,n,l,arg)
    try to resolve locally before using expensive global tree
    p = tree.find(n,l)
    if (p)
         if (p.n() == n && isactive(p)) 
            if (coeff(p)) 
                arg.set(coeff)
            else 
                if (islocal(p)) 
                    arg.set(empty)
                else 
                    forward the request
                    if (arg.islocal()) arg = SAV(msg...)
                    arg.msginfo(rank,tag)
                    am_send(...)
            return

         look for local node with parent coeffs
         while (!coeff(p) && p->parent)  
             p = p->parent

         if (isremote(p))
            forward request
            
         else if (coeff(p))
            recur down to make it
            if while recurring make a remote child
                forward the request, return
         else
            Uh?
            

    owner = find_owner(n,l)
    if (owner == me)
       Above logic should have caught this????
    else
        foward the request
