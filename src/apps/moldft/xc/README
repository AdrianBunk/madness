Functionals were obtained from the Density Functional Repository as
developed and distributed by the Quantum Chemistry Group, CCLRC
Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, Cheshire, WA4 4AD United
Kingdom. Contact Huub van Dam (h.j.j.vandam@dl.ac.uk) or Paul Sherwood
for further information.

The Fortran files in this directory were downloaded on 2/2/2008 from

  http://www.cse.scitech.ac.uk/ccg/dft/

and are unmodified.  

They were converted to C using f2c and no modifications have been made
to the C.  For one or more of the files it was necessary to use the
option -Nn1604 to f2c.  To enable compilation and linking without f2c
installed, a dummy f2c.h has been created in this directory and
necessary external functions implemented therein.


!! Note to MADNESS developers.  If you do modify either the C or
Fortran source in this directory please amend this file accordingly
and list changes below.  Note that if we refresh the Fortran from
Daresbury any changes to the C will have to be manually
reapplied.
