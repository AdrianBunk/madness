Some info about parsec compilation: 

In order for the compilation to work, the following modifications must
be done when compiling parsec (at ccmake . step):
1- Add -fPIC to CFLAGS
2- Set DAGUE_WITH_DEVEL_HEADERS ON
3- Set DAGUE_DIST_WITH_MPI OFF (with openMPI)
4- You have to run make install after make
5- Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to where parsec.pc is (PARSEC_INSTALL_DIR/lib/pkgconfig)

The cmake command for madness is (from a build directory):
cmake -Wno-dev -D
CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=PATH_to_MADNESS/cmake/toolchains/dancer_gcc.cmake
-D ENABLE_T\ BB=OFF -D ENABLE_MPI=OFF PATH_to_MADNESS

dancer_gcc.cmake is the configure file for a linux based machine
(update the paths and the CC and CXX compilers if needed, plus update the parsec directory).

Some info about the repo: 
It's a fork of madness. I created a branch (madness_over_parsec) of
the fork to safely push changes and leave master unchanged for updates
with the remote madness repository.
