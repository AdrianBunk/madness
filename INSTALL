We've temporarily (?) abandoned autoconf since
it was too painful on the bleeding edge machines.
No doubt it will return and our implementation is
meant to make this easy.

To configure MADNESS run the script doconfig
in the top level directory (same as this file).
On most machines it should just work, but you 
can fine tune things from the commandline.
It does NOT look in the environment for any info.

First, it accepts standard targets as keywords 
on the command line to direct the
build process which is important on machines with
cross compilers.  The currently understood targets
are

IBMBGL - not yet
CRAYXTGCC - not yet
CRAYXTPG - not yet
LINUX32
LINUX64

You can also provide the keyword debug to indicate
that you want the compilation options set suitable
for rapid compilation and debugging.

Values for variables may also be set on the command
line as a pair such as

doconfig LIBS "/local/atlas/something.a -lfred"

The list of interesting variables is in the configure
script.  At some point (hopefully) real documentation
will be written


Examples

Linux 64-bit using MKL in default install location
    ./doconfig LIBS "-L/opt/intel/mkl/9.1.023/lib/em64t -lmkl -lguide"
