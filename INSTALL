We've temporarily (?) abandoned autoconf since
it was too painful on the bleeding edge machines.
No doubt it will return and our implementation is
meant to make this easy.

To configure MADNESS run the script doconfig
in the top level directory (same as this file).
On most machines it should just work, but you 
can fine tune things from the commandline.
It does NOT look in the environment for any info.

First, it accepts standard targets as keywords 
on the command line to direct the
build process which is important on machines with
cross compilers.  The currently understood targets
are

IBMBGL - not yet
CRAYXT - for any configuration (PGC/GCC, Linux/Catamount)
LINUX32
LINUX64

You can also provide the keyword debug to indicate
that you want the compilation options set suitable
for rapid compilation and debugging.

Values for variables may also be set on the command
line as a pair such as

doconfig LIBS "/local/atlas/something.a -lfred"

The list of interesting variables is in the configure
script.  At some point (hopefully) real documentation
will be written


Examples

Linux 64-bit using MKL in default install location

    ./doconfig LIBS "-L/opt/intel/mkl/9.1.023/lib/em64t -lmkl -lguide"

Linux 32-bit using MKL in default install location

    ./doconfig LIBS "-L/opt/intel/mkl/10.0.1.014/lib/32 -lmkl -lguide"

CRAY-XT4 (ORNL Jaguar) with GNU compilers and ACML

    The GNU compilers are much faster (10x ?) at compilation than PGI hence
    these are recommended for development.  The runtime performance has not
    been evaluated.

    Build in your work directory (/tmp/work/username) since the user filesystem
    is bizarrely not accessible from the compute nodes

    [assuming default modules loaded]
    module swap PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-gnu
    module load subversion
    module load acml/4.1.0
    ./doconfig CRAYXT LIBS "-lacml -lgfortran"

    to run you will need to set an environment variable to point to
    the data files

    setenv MRA_DATA_DIR /tmp/work/$USER/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/trunk/src/lib/mra

CRAY-XT4 (ORNL Jaguar) with PGI compilers and SCILIB

    build in your work directory (/tmp/work/username) since the user filesystem
    is bizarrely not accessible from the compute nodes

    [assuming default modules loaded]
    ./doconfig CRAYXT LIBS ???????????????????????????

    to run you will need to set an environment variable to point to
    the data files

    setenv MRA_DATA_DIR /tmp/work/$USER/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/trunk/src/lib/mra
