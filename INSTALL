We are back to using autoconf and standard GNU configure scripts.

Prequisites:

  o  MPI-2

  o  BLAS

  o  LAPACK

  o  C and C++ compilers

  o  If you are building from the respository you will also need
     autoconf and automake.

How to build:

If you checked the source out of subversion you will need to build the
".in" files from the autoconf and automake templates (you do not need
to do this if building from the distribution tar file).  In the top
source directory (the one with configure.ac) run

     autoreconf

Assuming you are not cross compiling and that mpicxx and mpicc (or
equivalent) are in your path, you only need to tell configure where to
find your BLAS and LAPACK libraries (including any libraries necessary
to link against those libraries).  Some examples follow.

  o  64-bit Linux with Intel MKL installed.

     ./configure LIBS="-L/opt/intel/mkl/10.0.1.014/lib/em64t -lmkl -lguide -lpthread -lm"

  o  32-bit Linux with Intel MKL installed

     ./configure LIBS="-L/opt/intel/mkl/10.0.1.014/lib/32 -lmkl -lguide -lpthread -lm"

  o  Linux (32 or 64 bit) using system default BLAS and LAPACK
    
     ./configure LIBS="-llapack -lblas"

     (some systems might require additional libraries to resolve Fortran
      symbols used by LAPACK/BLAS)

Systems requiring special actions:

  o  Cray-XT (e.g., jaguar@ornl) with GNU compilers and ACML
     
     module load subversion
     module swap PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-gnu
     module load acml/4.1.0
     ./configure LIBS="-lacml -lacml_mv -lgfortran" CC=cc CXX=CC MPICC=cc MPICXX=CC

  o  Cray-XT (e.g., jaguar@ornl) with GNU compilers and scilib

     ?????

  o  Cray-XT (e.g., jaguar@ornl) with PGI compilers and ACML

     ?????

  o  Cray-XT (e.g., jaguar@ornl) with PGI compilers and scilib

     ?????

  o  IBM BlueGene-P

     ?????

  o  Smoky, the eccentric AMD+IB cluster at ORNL used for development. 
     This using MVAPICH2, GNU and ACML (my install of ACML though there 
     should module available for it now)

     module swap PE-pgi PE-gnu
     module load PE-gnu/4.2.0
     module swap ompi mvapich2
     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /ccs/home/harrison/smokyinstall/gfortran64_int64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ./configure LIBS="-L/ccs/home/harrison/smokyinstall/gfortran64_int64/lib  -lacml  -lacml_mv -lgfortran"
